# Some Notes about exceptional things

- Differentiatiating a non-differentiable continous function in integration by parts gives incorrect answer till you split at the discontinuity and take the left / right limiting value for the same
  However, if you assume the discontnuity is the dirac delta function, can you find the correct integral?
